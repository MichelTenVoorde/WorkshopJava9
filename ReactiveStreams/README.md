Reactive Streams
================

For a 2 minute introduction to Reactive Streams, check this out:
<https://medium.com/@andrestaltz/2-minute-introduction-to-rx-24c8ca793877>.


Some more background (the *Reactive Manifesto*) is right here:
<https://www.reactivemanifesto.org>/.


An overview of the Reactive Streams specification in Java 9 can be found here:
<http://javasampleapproach.com/java/java-9/java-9-flow-api-reactive-streams>.


There are 2 things to do here: first is a small exercise to get to know Reactive
Streams in Java. Second is a very nice demonstration (Twitter) app, with which
you can play around a bit.
