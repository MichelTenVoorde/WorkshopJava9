# Reactive Streams

Java 9 has Reactive Streams functionality baked into its SDK. For an introduction on Reactive Streams, good ol' Wikipedia has got you covered: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_Streams. Some more background (the *Reactive Manifesto*) is right here: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/.

We've found a very nice demonstration app, with which you can play around a bit. Just import the Maven project into your IDE if you'd like to fool around with the code.
